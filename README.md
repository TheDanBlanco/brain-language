## What is Brain?
Brain is a simple interpreted programming language, built primarily to deeply learn Rust.

## WARNING
Brain is still in the early stages of development. Backwards compatibility is not yet an overt goal, so expect breaking changes. Brain is not intended to be used in production scenarios and is not optimized for such. Use only if you're willing to work within these contstraints.

## Example

```javascript
let x = [1, 2, 3];

for item in collection {
    print(item * 2);
}

let y = { 'a': 1, 'b': 2 };

print(y.a);
```

More samples can be found in the `samples/` folder.

## Design Goals
* Capable in use
* Simplicity in design
* Ergonomic to use
* Extensible to develop
